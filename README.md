# Hotel-Chain-Dashboard

üè® __Hotels Analytics: Performance Dashboard for a Multi-Brand Hotel Chain Across India_: 
An executive-focused, interactive Power BI dashboard that tracks key performance metrics for a company operating multiple hotel brands across various cities in India. It highlights metrics such as Revenue, RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, and Realization, along with their trends across different demographics and time periods.

_The dashboard was built using the following tools & technologies_:-
1. üñ•Ô∏è Power BI Desktop ‚Äî for building interactive reports and dashboards
2. üîÑ Power Query ‚Äî for data cleaning and transformation
3. üßÆ DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äî for creating calculated columns and measures
4. üóÇÔ∏è Data Modelling ‚Äî for defining relationships and creating a robust data model
5. üìÑ File Format: .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews 

_Business Problem_:- The goal is to pinpoint hotels with lower revenue performance, analyze revenue across various booking channels, and gain insights into trends in key metrics such as Revenue, RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, and Realization. This will help identify growth opportunities and support operational improvements across the company‚Äôs multi-brand, multi-city hotel portfolio.

_Purpose_:- This dashboard is designed to provide a holistic view of key performance indicators, helping leadership teams track financial health, operational efficiency, and occupancy trends across diverse hotel categories and cities. It supports strategic planning and timely interventions to maximize profitability.

_Key Insights_:-
1. _Highest ADR on Own Booking Channel_: The Average Daily Rate (ADR) is highest on the company‚Äôs own booking platform. To stay competitive and maximize direct bookings, prices should be adjusted to match or undercut third-party platforms, leveraging the benefit of zero commission fees.
2. _Lack of Dynamic Pricing for Weekdays vs. Weekends_: Currently, pricing remains static throughout the week. Since occupancy rates are higher on weekends, implementing higher rates for weekends can help capture additional revenue.
3. _No Seasonal or Festive Price Adjustments_: ADR remains largely uniform across all time periods, indicating no dynamic pricing strategy for peak seasons or festive periods. Introducing flexible pricing during high-demand times can significantly increase revenue potential.
